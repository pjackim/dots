  The appbar doesn't get anymore the color from the material theme accent preference.
  So, if you want ex. indigo tint, you have to set the color separately by adding:

  {
    ...
    "material_theme_appbar_indigo": true,
    ...
  }

  By this way you can combine two colors. Check the full preferences in the readme file of the repository.
